Google TechTalk on WSGI, Middleware, Paste, and Pylons
======================================================

For those that haven't gotten on the WSGI bandwagon, are still confused
about Paste, how it fits into Pylons, and how its used in frameworks; I
gave a Google Techtalk last week that hopefully can clear a few things
up. The `talk is now up on Google
Video <http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-872784530622495809>`_
and the `slides are available as
PDF <http://groovie.org/files/WSGI_Presentation.pdf>`_. You'll want to
get the slides and follow along if you'd like to read the code samples
as the Google Video compression has turned them into large colorful
blurs.

The main focus of the talk is on WSGI, with a bit on Paste and Pylons as
well, and runs about 51 minutes. I could easily fill an hour or more
just on Pylons, which I plan on doing at some point.

**Disclaimers about the talk**

-  When I mention how the Rails routes code does extensive code
   generation, this mainly applied to the 1.0 and prior version of Rails
   routing. The Rails routing system got an overhaul around 1.1 that
   made it significantly easier to read, though that was also when the
   `security bug in the
   routing <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/6/27/rails-1-1-3-security-fix-and-minor-fixes>`_
   crept in.

-  Pony's are valuable, though I don't know why.

-  Yes, I realize that hot pink and its friends are not the best
   presentation colors.

Enjoy!
