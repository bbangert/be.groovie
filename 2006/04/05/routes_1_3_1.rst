Routes 1.3.1
============

Ah yes, time for another release. This time its
`Routes <http://routes.groovie.org/>`_ 1.3.1, nothing too big to see
here, thus the minor version increase. However if you were using Routes
with the ``prefix`` option its highly recommended that you upgrade as
there were 2 bugs specifically when used with that option that have been
fixed.

Also, for those that want all their URL's to end in a ``/``, there's now
a append\_slash option that will ensure URL's are generated exactly how
you want them to be.

Enjoy!
