Nice tidbits in Leopard
=======================

As many have blogged about, Apple has posted a rather hefty list
`describing all 300 new features of
Leopard <http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html>`_. Some
specifics that really got the coder in me excited:

(Highlighting emphasis all mine)

    *Cocoa Bridges*

    Use Ruby and **Python** as first-class languages for building Cocoa
    applications, thanks to Objective-C bridges as well as full Xcode
    and Interface Builder support.

    Scripting Bridge

    Use Objective-C, Ruby, and **Python** programs to automate Mac
    applications. The new Scripting Bridge enables them to easily
    generate AppleEvents using a concise, AppleScript-like syntax.

    Create Instruments with DTrace

    Monitor system activity from high-level application behavior down to
    the operating system kernel, all thanks to the power of DTrace and
    the instrument builder.

    DTrace

    Monitor virtually any aspect of your application with DTrace,
    integrated into the Darwin kernel. Java, Ruby, **Python**, and Perl
    have also been extended to support DTrace, providing unprecedented
    access for monitoring the performance characteristics of those
    languages.

While some of the things can be done now (There's PyObjC to use Python
with Cocoa), the tighter integration of Python and Ruby into Leopard
make it a very appealing upgrade (Even though I rather hate the new
semi-transparent menubar and odd shelf nature of the Dock).
