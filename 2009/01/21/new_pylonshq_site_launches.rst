New PylonsHQ Site Launches
==========================

The `new PylonsHQ site <http://pylonshq.com/>`_ has now launched!

The new site is running on the latest Pylons 0.9.7 code-base backed by
the `CouchDB database <http://couchdb.apache.org/>`_. New features that
have been added:

-  `Snippet <http://pylonshq.com/snippets>`_ repository
-  `Traceback <http://pylonshq.com/tracebacks>`_ posting
-  Easier to read `buildbot status
   page <http://pylonshq.com/buildbot/index>`_
-  `Trac user
   integration <http://pylonshq.com/project/pylonshq/roadmap>`_, so your
   login to the main PylonsHQ site is carried into Trac seamlessly
-  Feeds for the various sections, including the `new
   blog <http://pylonshq.com/articles>`_
-  All new `documentation <http://pylonshq.com/docs/en/0.9.7/>`_ using
   `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
-  OpenID registration and sign-up
-  All PylonsHQ code open-sourced and `available on
   BitBucket <http://bitbucket.org/bbangert/kai/overview/>`_

Unfortunately, we were unable to integrate the Wiki's auth, so that will
still require a separate login for now.

Comments are through-out the site, to ensure that feedback isn't missed
and of course there's many more features planned that are coming soon.
The site isn't quite 100% complete, as a few links here and there are
likely broken yet (like the tutorial links on the front page). I'll be
putting out frequent updates to remedy this and any other little bits
that need more polish.

Enjoy!
