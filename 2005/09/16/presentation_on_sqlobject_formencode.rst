Presentation on SQLObject & FormEncode
======================================

I gave a presentation tonight on SQLObject & FormEncode for the Bay Area
Python Users Group (BayPiggies). `Here are the slides for the
presentation </files/SQLObjectFormEncodePresentation.pdf>`_, which
actually have 3 extra slides I didn't show during the presentation
because I forgot they were there (doh!).

Anyways, there were rather important I think as they actually showed two
common cases where you'd want to use
`SQLObject <http://www.sqlobject.org/>`_ and
`FormEncode <http://formencode.org/>`_ together. That is, for moving
data from a CSV file to a database, and for dealing with web forms. The
latter of which I previously described in much more detail on here but
it would've been nice to go over in the presentation, ah well.

If you're curious about `FormEncode <http://formencode.org/>`_, I put a
decent amount of info into it along with some examples. It's worth
checking out if you're ever in need of data validation and converting
data types.
