Rails Routes port project page is up
====================================

I've gotten a `project site <http://routes.groovie.org/>`_ setup for the
Routes port I created. Currently the port passes all the applicable unit
tests I copied from the Rails route testing package. It's very rough
right now, but a few people expressed an interest in seeing the current
code so now its up.

I will be putting it under a BSD license shortly to make it easier to
use with whatever other Python Web Frameworks are interested in using
it.

The noticable area its not working in right now, is handling GET args
and generating them with extra keys. So I wouldn't consider this code
ready for use in an actual website yet. Hopefully the remaining features
to implement will be done shortly, and I'll have some examples of using
Routes with `Myghty <http://www.myghty.org/>`_.
