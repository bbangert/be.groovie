Dissing Programming Langauges...
================================

A friend recently brought to my attention that I seem to have a knack
for insulting a language based on a quick overview without actually
getting into it. After thinking about this awhile I've noticed it
definitely seems to be more of a trend than I'd like.

The latest example of this was Ruby, but before that Python (Lisp before
that). With each language, I'd find new things to nitpick on before
really diving in (Which I always seemed to do anyways). As a result of
this, I think its time for me to really grow up and stop picking on new
languages till I've at least had the time to write a few apps in them
and truly understand where they're lacking.

As a quick side-note, here are the things I found to nitpick on before
actually learning these languages:

-  Objective-C: God, wtf is up with these [] all over the place?
-  Lisp: God, wtf is up with these () all over the place?
-  Python: God, wtf is up with these \_\_\_\_\_ all over the place, and
   who in their right mind uses white-space to designate blocks?
-  Ruby: God, wtf is up with these {\|\| } things all over the place?

Obviously I had issues with syntax, I hope to have purged myself of
these issues as of this writing. Remember, sometimes a language has a
damn good reason to have crazy characters all over the place.
