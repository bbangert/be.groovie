Where's Single Sign-On??
========================

Really. I mean it. Where's Single Sign-On?

`Liberty Allienace <http://www.projectliberty.org/>`_ was started 4
years ago to provide a competing alternative to `Microsoft's
Passport <http://www.passport.net/>`_. It's taken Liberty Alliance years
to get to any sort of usable starting point, while Microsoft has
actually had developer code out there and usable since 2001. I've even
toyed with some Passport login code in Perl 4 years ago.

Since that time, Passport is used rarely if ever on the web, and the
Liberty Alliance has tons of docs to show, implementation specs, and
even a `Java toolkit for Liberty
Alliance <http://www.sourceid.org/projects/id-ff-1.2-java-toolkit.html>`_.
Yet I don't see many (or any?) websites using the federated login of
Liberty Alliance. Where's my single sign-on??

In the time of `Web 2.0 <http://www.web2con.com/>`_ a toolkit for the
major scripting languages should exist. Why isn't there one for PHP?
Perl? Python? Rails? Has anyone done any calculations in how “good” a
website or web service has to be before a user is ready to take the
plunge to setup **yet another username/password**? This is an obstacle
that gets in the way of a website having more members, and anyone in the
business of getting members should want as few obstacles as possible.

I know I'm not even signing up or using some services purely because I
can't deal with yet another username/password to remember. I can't even
remember the ones I'm currently signed up for, so I have to use software
that does password/site remembering for me, in my case `Password
Wallet <http://www.selznick.com/products/passwordwallet/>`_.

So what are the supposed strenghts of web services/applications?

#. You don't need to install any software
#. You don't need to worry about upgrades
#. You can use it anywhere

Out of these, #3 is the one that has been lost nowadays thanks to a
password/username program. I can't get to any website I've registered on
without my personal computer, because I can't remember that many
usernames and passwords. Some will say, “just use the same user/password
everywhere”, and many people do. Even this doesn't always work though,
if someone else signed up using that username first.

It's been **FOUR YEARS** since the big hub-bub over Microsoft Password
and Liberty Alliance, and we **still** don't have handy little toolkits
in the most commonly used scripting languages to interact with them. I
don't know about you, but I find this pretty sad.
