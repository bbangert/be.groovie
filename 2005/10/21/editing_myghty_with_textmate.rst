Editing Myghty with TextMate
============================

`TextMate <http://macromates.com/>`_ is a rather slick little text
editor, with a bunch of cool automation stuff thats great for
programmers. You've probably already seen it if you've `watched
any <http://turbogears.com/docs/wiki20/20MinuteWiki.mov>`_ `of those
demo
movies <http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov>`_
for some of the latest web frameworks.

Anyways, as I mainly use `Myghty <http://www.myghty.org/>`_, I needed a
syntax highlighting mode for its format. So I made a `Myghty bundle for
TextMate </files/Myghty.tmbundle.zip>`_. This should also be useful for
those using `Mason <http://www.masonhq.com/>`_ as only a few minor
adjustments regarding the underlying language highlighter need to be
tweaked (Change source.python -> source.perl). This also has a few
automation snippets to speed things up.

To install:

-  Unzip
-  Drag into ``~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/``
-  Restart TextMate (Not absolutely sure this is needed though)

Enjoy!
