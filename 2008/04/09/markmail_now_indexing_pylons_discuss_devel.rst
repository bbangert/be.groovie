MarkMail now indexing Pylons-discuss/devel
==========================================

I'm thrilled to announce that `MarkMail <http://markmail.org/>`_ now
indexes the `Pylons-dicuss and Pylons-devel mail
lists <http://markmail.org/search/list:pylons>`_. For those looking for
a great way to search and browser the Pylons mail lists, the MarkMail
interface is top-notch.

For those looking for detailed Pylons docsâ€¦. there's some very exciting
developments in the documentation front coming up shortly that will make
you rather happy. :)
