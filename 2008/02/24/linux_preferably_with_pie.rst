Linux, preferably with Pie
==========================

From a Python job posting last year that I just happened to recently
actually read for reasons that escape me.

    Description: Python Developer
     The Greenivy Group is a consulting firm with clients in the
    metropolitan NY/NJ area. This project is for a major player in the
    telecom industry. The client needs a seasoned Python developer to
    code applications in Linux utilizing Cheeta, mod\_Python, and/or
    Cherry Pie.

Mmmmm…. cherry pie…
