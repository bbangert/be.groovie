Getting Inspired
================

I've never been to `TED <http://www.ted.com/>`_, but wow are the talks
there inspiring and insightful. They also cover a wide range of topics
far beyond just IT. The majority of the talks are also available online,
some in high quality 480 progressive mp4 as well.

The best thing I've always found about going to conferences, is the
inspiration that I can get and find in the talks others give. TED
inspires in a different way, so here's a few of my favorites and why:

**`Dr. Dean Ornish: The world now eats (and dies) like
Americans <http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/10>`_**
Only **3 minutes, WATCH IT**. The power of your diet to kill you is
rather amazing, if you want an even more comprehensive background on
this, read `The China
Study <http://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100385>`_

**`Might You Live a Great Deal
Longer? <http://www.ted.com/index.php/themes/view/id/44>`_**
A very fascinating theme, which includes several talks, including the
short 3 minute one I cited separately in the hopes more people would
watch it. :)

**`Richard Dawkins: An atheist's call to
arms <http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/113>`_**
This one is sure to get a few people in a huff, for Richard Dawkins has
few kind words for those who hold religious beliefs dear to their heart.
But its a very interesting talk on science, and oddly enough I didn't
find it very scornful (which some do), probably my background in
Philosophy.

**`Blaise Aguera y Arcas: Jaw-dropping Photosynth
Demo <http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/129>`_**
This one has been posted by people before, I have to include it cause
its definitely rather incredible to see. Definitely a tech theme on this
one.

*And finally, one of the most relevant to our current crises with
regards to the environment and sustainabilityâ€¦*

**`Janine Benyus: 12 sustainable design ideas from
nature <http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/18>`_**
A very exciting talk about work being done to copy sustainable ideas
from nature, also called biomimicry. If you're looking for an upper,
this one definitely left my with a smile and some hope for future
developments that don't require us to devastate places with mining,
pollute the environment shipping raw materials around the world, etc.

I'm sure I missed a lot of good videos, if there's something that really
inspired or awed you that can be found in the TED talks, please share!
