WSGI/Pylons Talk in San Francisco tonight (Dec 3rd)
===================================================

I'll be giving a talk tonight about WSGI, making apps using it, and
Pylons tonight in San Francisco. If you live in the Bay Area and have
been wanting to learn more about some of the packages utilizing WSGI, as
well as Pylons, RSVP soon as they'd like to get some numbers for food.

Here's the `meetup event page for the
talk <http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/calendar/9194676/>`_. This is one
of the longer talks I've given, so I should actually have enough time to
cover the topics (WSGI, WSGI Middleware, making low-level WSGI apps with
WebOb, making small WSGI stacks, and Pylons) in good detail, as well as
some demonstrations.
