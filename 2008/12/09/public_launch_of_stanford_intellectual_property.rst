Public launch of Stanford Intellectual Property Litigation Clearinghouse
========================================================================

At long last, we've finally launched the `Stanford IPLC
website <http://lexmachina.stanford.edu/>`_ that I've been working on
for the past year. It's quite nice to finally have something out there
that I can show people, though I know its definitely more of a niche
area of interest, as not everyone is probably as interested in
intellectual property litigation as I am. :)

This site is running `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com/>`_ of course, with
various other technologies I'm unable to disclose powering the back-end.

Note that signing up **requires a valid e-mail address** as e-mail
confirmations are sent out to them. For those that are keen to keep up
on what's going on with patent litigation, hopefully our website can
help out.
