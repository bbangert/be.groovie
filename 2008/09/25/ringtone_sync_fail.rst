Ringtone sync FAIL
==================

I've had an iPhone for about a month now, quite loving it. Today I
decided to add some custom ringtones to it, so I went into iTunes and
clicked the button to sync ringtonesâ€¦

   Sync FAIL
**Really?** They couldn't find any way to add a few ringtones without
removing (erasing) all the music I already dragged over? Really???
