Book Meme
=========

`Via <http://jtauber.com/blog/2008/11/12/book_meme/>`_ :

-  Grab the nearest book.
-  Open it to page 56.
-  Find the fifth sentence.
-  Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these
   instructions.
-  Don't dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual
   one: pick the CLOSEST.

From **The Omnivore's Deilemma** by Michael Pollan:

    And then of course there's the corn itself, which if corn could form
    an opinion would surely marvel at the absurdity of it all — and at
    its great good fortune.

I don't usually do the meme thing, but I happened to have a book on my
desk so it took so little effort… only one chapter to go!
