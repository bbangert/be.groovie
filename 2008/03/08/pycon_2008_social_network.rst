PyCon 2008 Social Network
=========================

Normally I'm not a fan of social networks, I always seem to get bored
quickly. The one time that I actually find myself using them however, is
with conferences. The relevance of the immediately upcoming event makes
it quite a bit more interesting, and I've found it a great way to find
people at conferences that I'd like to meet and remember who I met
afterwards.

As `Doug mentioned
earlier <http://pycon.blogspot.com/2008/03/social-web-sites-for-pycon-2008.html>`_,
there's several social sites for PyCon 2008 up. I suggested a
`Crowdvine <http://www.crowdvine.com/>`_ network as well, and have set
one up for all PyCon 2008 attendees.

Sign Up!
--------

For those attending PyCon 2008, consider `joining the PyCon 2008
Crowdvine network <http://pycon2008.crowdvine.com/>`_. Some handy things
to do after joining:

-  Add a picture. That'll help people put a name to a face.
-  Fill out your profile. This will help people find you.
-  Find people you want to meet. From their profile you can let them
   know that you are a “fan” or that you “want-to-meet.” Or you leave a
   comment with something more specific.

Cheers!
